\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.1}{What is the main difference between the phosphorus \(P\) and nitrogen \(N\) cycles that contributes to greater limitation to P than N in tropical ecosystems relative to temperate ecosystems?}{}% 1
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.2}{The use of fertilizer \(mainly N and P\) has undoubtedly increased crop yields globally. However, research suggests that this fertilizer use can have other impacts on terrestrial ecosystems because not all fertilizer is taken up by the crops. How might use of fertilizer impact ecosystem services?}{}% 2
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.3}{Did you find any negative ecosystem service impacts in response to question 1? If so, how could we avoid these while maintaining crop productivity?}{}% 3
