\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.1}{Draw three figures to illustrate how \(1\) temperature, \(2\) litter C/N ratio, and \(3\) soil microbial biomass influence litter decomposition. Next to each figure indicate why you expect the trend you illustrated.}{}% 1
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.2}{How do you think eutrophication \(the addition of nutrients to soils\) will influence carbon stored in soils? Provide your answer in the form of a hypothesis with both the expected response and biological reasoning.}{}% 2
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.3}{How do you think elevated atmospheric CO2 will influence carbon stored in soils? Provide your answer in the form of a hypothesis with both the expected response and biological reasoning.}{}% 3
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.4}{How do you think increasing temperature will influence carbon stored in soils? Provide your answer in the form of a hypothesis with both the expected response and biological reasoning.}{}% 4
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.5}{From the NEP equation \(NEP = GPP - \(Rplant + Rhet\)\), reductions in heterotrophic respiration would seem to be a way to increase NEP and thus, reduce atmospheric CO2. What feedback may preclude this from working? Provide your answer with text and a systems diagram.}{}% 5
