\section{\small{Draw three figures to illustrate how (1) temperature, (2) litter C/N ratio,
and (3) soil microbial biomass influence litter decomposition. Next to each figure indicate
why you expect the trend you illustrated.}}

\section{\small{How do you think eutrophication (the addition of nutrients to soils) will influence
carbon stored in soils? Provide your answer in the form of a hypothesis with both the expected
response and biological reasoning.}}

\section{\small{From the NEP equation (NEP = GPP - (Rplant + Rhet)), reductions in heterotrophic respiration would seem
to be a way to increase NEP and thus, reduce atmospheric CO2. What feedback may preclude this
from working? Provide your answer with text and a systems diagram.}}
